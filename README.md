# wordle

This is a CLI word-guessing game. The computer will randomly generate a five-letter secret word from a word bank. User will have to guess a valid five-letter word to start the game. If the user's guess word contains letters in the secret word, that letter will return as either upper or lower case. The letter will return in upper case if the letter position matches the secret word. The letter will return in lower case if the letter is in the secret word but in the wrong position. User only has six attempts to guess the secret word.
